# Topics & Subjects List
A list of **some** *important for me to mention* topics and CS or SWE disciplines that I've studied in **university classes** and that I've researched and **learned on my own**.

I've also mentioned some interests of mine in decentralised, distruibuted networks and the crypto world, AI and machine learning, HPC and automation systems at the end of this README file.

Personal research list from 2017-ish to 2019-ish:
1. Algorithms
1. Access Control Systems & Linux Hardening
1. AI Software & Research
1. Alternative & Quantum Computing
1. Modern Programming Language Architectures
1. Blockchain Security, Consensus Mechanisms & Smart Contract Usage

### Algorithms
Steadly building my own (chosen structures and parts) standard library in C and C++ programming languages with CMake, GCC/G++ and AppleClang. Also implementing various coding tasks, going forward in improving my problem solving skills.

### AppArmor & Linux Hardening
Did a semester project for a cyber security college course about AppArmor. Will be researching more about ways of hardening Linux for my bachelor's in cyber security. Tinkered with Qubes OS, Kali Linux, Debian, Parrot OS and various Ubuntu flavours.

### Machine Learning
Was interested a lot about this topic but I've also forgotten much of it. Learned about image networks and ways of classification and regression in machine learning models.

### Quantum Computing
Implemented the Grover's search algorithm in IBM Q Experience. Read a lot about why quantum computing could be an alternative way of compute in the future. This technology is quite in its infancy I think. It's very difficult to maintain a quantum system do to the laws of quantum mechanics, and it's non deterministic nature.

### Modern Programming Language Architectures
Looked into Swift and Go.

### Crypto
In Dec 2018 I've looked at some blockchain projects and decided to wait for this tech to mature more. 

Some of them are: 

1. Bitcoin (lightning transactions, PoW evolution, 51% attack problems, Dandelion mechanism)
1. Ethereum (PoS evolution, Vitalik's presentations, online commentaries, Andrew Antonopoulos commentaries)
1. Monero (privacy mechanisms, ring confidential transactions, network size problem)
1. Chainlink (smart contract usage evolution, sybil attacks)
1. Grim (MimbleWimble protocol)
1. Other (incentive structure, zero knowledge proofs, various consensus mechanisms, permissioned chains, "blockchain" databases)
1. Relative (IPFS, cryptography evolution, "distributing" philosophy)

... I'll keep looking into some of these.
