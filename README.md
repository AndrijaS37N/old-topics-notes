# Topics & Subjects List
A list of **some** *important for me to mention* topics and CS or SWE disciplines that I've studied in **university classes** and that I've researched and **learned on my own**.
I've also mentioned some interests of mine in decentralised, distruibuted networks and the crypto world, AI and machine learning, HPC and automation systems.

... I must be forgetting some at this moment of course.

### Crypto
In Dec 2018 I've look at some blockchain projects and decided then to wait for this tech to mature more. 

Some of them are: 

1. Bitcoin (Lightning transactions, PoW evolution, 51% attack problems, Dandelion mechanism)
1. Ethereum (PoS evolution, Vitalik's presentations, online commentaries, Andrew Antonopoulos commentaries, etc.)
1. Monero (privacy mechanisms, ring confidential transactions, network size problem)
1. Chainlink (smart contract usage evolution, sybil attacks)
1. Grim (MimbleWimble protocol)
1. Other (incentive structure, zero knowledge proofs, various consensus mechanisms, permissioned chains, blockchain dbs)
1. Relative (IPFS, cryptography evolution, "distributing" philosophy)
