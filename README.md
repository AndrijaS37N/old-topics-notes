Personal research list from 2017-ish to 2019-ish:
1. Algorithms
1. Access Control Systems & Linux Hardening
1. AI Software & Research
1. Alternative & Quantum Computing
1. Modern Programming Language Architectures
1. Blockchain Security, Consensus Mechanisms & Smart Contract Usage

### Crypto
In Dec 2018 I've looked at some blockchain projects and decided to wait for this tech to mature more. 

Some of them are: 

1. Bitcoin (lightning transactions, PoW evolution, 51% attack problems, Dandelion mechanism)
1. Ethereum (PoS evolution, Vitalik's presentations, online commentaries, Andrew Antonopoulos commentaries)
1. Monero (privacy mechanisms, ring confidential transactions, network size problem)
1. Chainlink (smart contract usage evolution, sybil attacks)
1. Grim (MimbleWimble protocol)
1. Other (incentive structure, zero knowledge proofs, various consensus mechanisms, permissioned chains, "blockchain" databases)
1. Relative (IPFS, cryptography evolution, "distributing" philosophy)
